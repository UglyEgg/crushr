# crushr Development Status

Current Phase: Phase 2 — Comparative Corruption Research

Current Step: 2.1 cleanup complete (CRUSHR-P2-CLEAN-02 structured invocation provenance in Phase 2 execution records)

Recent completed packet: CRUSHR-P2-CLEAN-02 (removed narrative command-string provenance from Phase 2 execution records; added structured invocation metadata captured from actual command execution path)

## Current truth

- Phase 1 is complete.
- Phase 2.1 packets CRUSHR-P2.1-A/B/C/D are complete: `crushr-lab` now has typed Phase 2 manifest/scenario structures, deterministic locked-core scenario enumeration (2160 runs), deterministic dataset fixture builders (`smallfiles`, `mixed`, `largefiles`), deterministic inventory/provenance emission, typed archive build execution records for `crushr`, `tar+zstd`, `zip`, and `7z/lzma`, a locked corruption injection engine (`bit_flip`, `byte_overwrite`, `zero_fill`, `truncation`, `tail_damage`) with locked targets/magnitudes/seeds and deterministic mutation provenance, and a manifest-driven execution runner that emits typed `RawRunRecord` evidence plus completeness audits over missing/duplicate/mismatched scenario IDs.
- Cleanup packets CRUSHR-CLEANUP-2.0-C and CRUSHR-CLEANUP-2.0-D are complete.
- Cleanup packet CRUSHR-P2-CLEAN-01 is complete: deleted packet-era scaffold experiment commands/helpers/tests and reduced `crushr-lab` main dispatch/help surface to `corrupt`, `write-phase2-manifest`, `build-phase2-foundation`, and `run-phase2-execution`.
- Cleanup packet CRUSHR-P2-CLEAN-02 is complete: replaced hand-authored command prose (`observed_command`) in `RawRunRecord.execution_metadata` with structured invocation metadata (`tool_kind`, executable, argv, cwd, exit status, stdout/stderr artifact paths) captured directly from the real `Command` invocation before/after execution.
- Active machine-readable schemas are now tightened contracts for: `crushr-info` snapshot, `crushr-fsck` snapshot, `crushr-impact` report, extraction result, and propagation graph.
- Integration tests now perform real JSON Schema instance-vs-schema validation for active outputs.

## Active constraints

- Minimal v1 scope: regular files, one block per file.
- No speculative recovery/reconstruction/repair.
- Strict extraction semantics remain canonical.
- `schemas/crushr-impact.v1.schema.json` remains active as a nested contract dependency (used by fsck blast-radius payload and direct impact report typing); no obsolete schema was deleted in this packet.

## Next action

Start Phase 2.2 comparative mapping/reporting packet (consume Phase 2.1 raw run records and map tool-specific outputs into normalized comparative result contracts).
